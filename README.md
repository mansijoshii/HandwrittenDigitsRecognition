# HandwrittenDigitsRecognition

This is a deep learning project based on Artificial Neural Networks to recognise handwritten digits. 

Coding language used - Python.

Opensource library used - Tensorflow.

I have built and trained my own multi layer perceptron rather than using Keras.

The model was trained using MNIST database and an accuracy of 97.87% was achieved.
